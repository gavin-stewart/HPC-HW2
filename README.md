All programs can be compiled by running make.  jacobi2d-omp and gs2D-omp require two arguments: the first argument is the number of gridpoints in the x and y directions, and the second argument is the maximum number of iterations.  To compile the Jacobi and GS methods to run serially, pass the argument SERIAL=T to make (e.g. make SERIAL=T)
